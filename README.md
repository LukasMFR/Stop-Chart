# Stop-Chart (Legacy iOS 13 Support)

This version of Stop Chart is a special edition designed for photographers using older Apple devices, offering support for iOS 13 and watchOS 6. It provides easy access to the essential "stop charts" for photography parameters, helping photographers make informed decisions about exposure, aperture, and ISO settings. While developed initially with earlier versions of SwiftUI, this legacy version maintains a user-friendly interface, tailored to work seamlessly on devices not supporting iOS 14.0 and watchOS 7.0 or newer.

## Overview

The legacy version of Stop Chart continues to empower photographers by providing quick insights into three critical "stop charts" from their older iOS and watchOS devices. It retains its valuable features and functionality, ensuring that even users with devices running iOS 13 or watchOS 6 can capture the perfect shot under any conditions.

**Languages Supported:** Stop Chart is available in both English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, making it accessible to a wider audience of photographers around the globe.

## Code Originality and Dependencies

This legacy version of Stop Chart strives to remain as true to the original codebase as possible, mirroring the version available on the App Store in 2019/2020. It represents the app in its original form, ensuring that users and developers experience the application as it was initially designed, with minimal alterations. However, please note that this codebase lacks the CocoaPods dependencies, such as the Podfile, that were used for integrating Google Ads into the application. This exclusion is intended to simplify the setup process and reduce the potential for third-party issues, focusing on the core functionality of Stop Chart.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Stop Charts**: Access detailed charts for exposure, aperture, and ISO settings.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. Compatible with iOS 13.0 and watchOS 6.0 or newer.
- **Intuitive Design**: Although developed with an earlier version of SwiftUI, it provides a seamless user experience.
- **Multilingual Support**: Available in English and French.
- **Independent Apple Watch App**: The app on Apple Watch supports running without the need for the iOS app installation, offering flexibility and convenience.

## Installation

This legacy version of Stop Chart requires iOS 13.0 and watchOS 6.0, but it has been tested and confirmed to still work on devices running up to iOS 17 and watchOS 10 as of the writing of this README.
